My name is Sanne Smith and I am the Program Director of the ([Education Data Science Master](https://ed.stanford.edu/eds) at the [Stanford Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/). My teaching centers around the question of how various sources of quantitative data can inform us about teaching and learning. With my students, I explore how we can responsibly and thoughtfully process, visualize, and analyze education data by focusing on technical skills as well as ethical and practical questions.
