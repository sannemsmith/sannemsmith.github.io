title: "Education Data Science MS"
---
I oversee the [Education Data Science MS](https://ed.stanford.edu/eds) at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. I take great effort, care, and pride in supporting students during their graduate school journey. From the first inquiries about the program to hooding freshly minted graduates: It is truly an honor for me to work with fantastic young scholars and professionals. 

If you are interested in joining the program, please take a look at our EDS MS website. I don't always manage to respond to each question individually, so be sure to sign up for virtual webinars (Fall) or in-person opportunities (Spring) to connect. 

If you are interested in collaborating with the EDS program (e.g., internships or research project opportunities), please don't hesitate to reach out!
